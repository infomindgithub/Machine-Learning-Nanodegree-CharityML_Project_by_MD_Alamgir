# Machine-Learning-Nanodegree-CharityML_Project_by_MD_Alamgir
This machine learning project uses several supervised classifier algorithms (Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Ensemble, Gaussian Naive Bayes, LinearSVC, Decision Tree, and Stochastic Gradient Descent) to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The best candidate algorithm is thenchosen from preliminary results and this algorithm is further optimized to best model the data. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we demonstrate in this project) infer this value from other publically available data features. The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
